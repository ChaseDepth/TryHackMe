Regular expressions
Regex, It is a pattern of text I define to search documents and match exactly what I’m looking for
	https://regexr.com/
A charset is define by [ ] and allows to search for patterns
[abc] will match a, b, and c for every letter
[abc]zzz will match azz, bzz, and czz
- defines ranges, so [a-c]zzz is the same above
[a-cx-z] looks for a,b,c,x,y,z so [a-c-x-z]zz matches with azz, bzz, czz, xzz, yzz, and zzz
[a-zA-Z] case sensitive lower and upper
file[1-3] file1, file2, and file3
^ excludes a character
[^k]ing will match ring, sing, $ing but not king. It will search for everything else with -ing but king.
You can add range to exclusions too
[^a-c] will match dat, eat, fat…
	Note that this matches occurrences and not strings so [abc] can match with cba.
. is a wild card. a.c can match aac, a!c, doesn’t matter.
? is optional so abc? will match a, ab, abc, c. Doesn’t matter
To actually look for a period, you need \. so a\.c will only match a.c
There are shortcuts for charsets
	\d  any single digit like 9
	\D any non-digit like A or @
	\w for alphanumeric like a or 3 and even _ so reasonable for strings
	\W for non-alphanumeric like ! or #
	\s matches whitespaces like spaces, tabs, and line breaks
	\S matches everything else but whitespace
{2} will look any characters that repeat twice. z{2} will look for zz
{1,5} 1-5 times
{2,} 2 or more times
* 0 or more times
+ 1 or more times
^abc means the character set starts with abc . Note that [^a] with the parathesis means to exclude! 
xyz$ means the character sets ends with xyz
( ) encloses groups of characters. Imagine pemdas. 
| means or
during the (day|night) matches
	during the day
	during the night
(no){5} matches with nonononono
\$ to find $ specifically
actually \. or \% or \^ to find those specific characters. \ specifies to find that special character
@ doesn’t need \
